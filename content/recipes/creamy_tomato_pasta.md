# One-Pot Creamy Tomato Pasta

**Serves:** 4 (double portion for freezing)  
**Cook time:** 20 mins

Easy, tasty and very little clean-up! It's a great midweek dinner that also works well as a cold salad the next day if you make extra. We love to serve this with a hunk of crusty bread to clean up the juices left on the plate.

## Ingredients (Double Portion - Cook to Freeze Point)

- 1 onion
- 3 cloves of garlic
- 1 aubergine
- 150g mushrooms of your choice
- 1Â½ tablespoons oil
- 1 tablespoon tamari/soy sauce
- 100ml water
- 2 x 400g tins of chopped tomatoes
- 100g tomato purÃ©e
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- Â½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 500ml vegetable stock
- 500ml non-dairy milk (we use oat milk)
- 500g wholemeal pasta (use gluten-free if you prefer)
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast (optional)

To garnish:
- a small bunch of fresh basil
- chilli flakes
- a little nutritional yeast

## Instructions

1. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Slice the aubergine into small bite-size pieces and finely chop the mushrooms.

2. Put a large saucepan on a high heat and fry the onion and garlic in the oil for 2 minutes, stirring regularly until they start to brown. Add the aubergine and mushrooms and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add the tamari and cook until it has all been absorbed or evaporated (about 2 minutes), then pour in the water and cook for a further 5 minutes. Both the aubergine and mushrooms should be soft and super tasty by now.

**ðŸ¥¶ FREEZE POINT:** At this stage, you can freeze half the mixture. Cool completely and freeze in a container. When ready to use, thaw overnight in the fridge and continue with the remaining steps using the half-quantities below.

## Ingredients (Half Portion - After Thawing)

- Â½ onion (already cooked in frozen portion)
- 1Â½ cloves of garlic (already cooked in frozen portion)
- Â½ aubergine (already cooked in frozen portion)
- 75g mushrooms (already cooked in frozen portion)
- Â¾ tablespoon oil (already used in frozen portion)
- Â½ tablespoon tamari/soy sauce (already used in frozen portion)
- 50ml water (already used in frozen portion)
- 1 x 400g tin of chopped tomatoes
- 50g tomato purÃ©e
- Â½ tablespoon maple syrup
- Â¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 250ml vegetable stock
- 250ml non-dairy milk
- 250g wholemeal pasta
- 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast (optional)

## Instructions (Continued from thawed portion)

3. Add the tinned tomatoes, tomato purÃ©e, maple syrup and black pepper and mix well. Stir in the stock and non-dairy milk, finally adding the pasta. If using spaghetti, break it up so that it all fits into the pan and is submerged in the liquid. Mix well.

4. Once it starts to boil, reduce the heat and leave to simmer so that the liquid starts to evaporate. Every so often, use a wooden spoon to gently mix through the pasta, making sure it doesn't stick together.

5. Once the sauce is reduced and the pasta is cooked (check the packet for the cooking time), add the nutritional yeast (if using). Taste and add more salt if needed.

6. Tear the basil leaves roughly and sprinkle them over each portion when serving, along with some chilli flakes, more nutritional yeast (and some grated cheese if you fancy it).

## Freezing Notes

- This recipe is designed to cook a double portion up to the freeze point (after step 2)
- Freeze half the cooked vegetable mixture and continue with the remaining half using full quantities for steps 3-6
- When using the frozen portion, thaw overnight and use the half-quantities listed above for the remaining ingredients
- The handwritten quantities take precedence as they've been tested and adjusted for optimal results
